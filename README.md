# Data Analyst Associate Practical Exam Submission

## Overview
This project is a submission for the Data Analyst Associate practical exam. The objective is to perform data analysis and create visualizations using various tools and techniques to demonstrate proficiency in handling data, conducting analyses, and presenting insights effectively.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis:** Includes tasks such as data cleaning, manipulation, and exploration to derive meaningful insights from the provided dataset.
- **Visualization:** Employs a variety of charts and plots to visualize key findings and support data-driven conclusions.
- **Tools Used:** Utilizes Python libraries including Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: The main programming language used for all analysis and visualization tasks.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and transformation.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating a variety of visualizations to illustrate findings.
